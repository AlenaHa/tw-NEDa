### NEDa project
***
> The `Web Application NEDa` consists in an application that provides information regarding `earthquakes in Nepal` in an interactive/visual way. 
In this application the user is able to explore, filter, view and actualize the information by navigating through the multi-visual provided pages. 

> _NEDa project_ consists in creating an interactive way of presenting the information regarding the Nepal earthquakes. The users will be served with different data-view types like data tables, charts and others. The substrate of any Http request consists in a query over the database. After the request is processed, the answer will be served to the client in the chosen  graphic mode.
The application contains a _backend module_ with a database in which there are several tables containing data of interest regarding the earthquakes in Nepal like : `earthquakes`, `population`, `location`, `supplies` and `ong`. Based on this information, in the frontend module, the app provides a table view on which the user is able to do different actions like: data filtering or `geo-location` finding based on each location coordinates.
>>The application also contains a front-end module that provides implementation for the graphic part of the project from which the user can enjoy.
